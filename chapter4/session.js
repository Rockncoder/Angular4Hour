Gone are the days of single-tier, battle-ship gray, boring user interfaces. Users demand that your applications (or portions) run on more than one device. This session will take you on a tour of how you should be architecting your application by breaking it up into services. You will learn how to create your business rules and data layer as a service. This seminar will assume you have some knowledge of .NET but have been developing applications the old way and you are now looking to see how to use WCF and the Model-View-View-Model (MVVM) design pattern to create applications that can be run one more than one user interface platform. This session has many demonstrations and you will be led step-by-step through the code.

You can use LINQ to SQL or the Entity Framework to generate code that creates these collections of objects for you. However, Microsoft loves to abandon technologies every other year, so if you know how to build your own object collections using technology that is tried and true, then you are not relying on Microsoft staying consistent. Using ADO.NET for data access and building classes with properties and methods has not changed since .NET 1.0. In this seminar you will learn to use a DataTable to fill a collection of objects. You will then see how to use a DataReader to fill the same collection of objects. You will also see how to use LINQ to iterate over a DataTable to build your entity collection.

InRelease serves as a Continuous Delivery solution for .NET teams that automates the release process from Visual Studio Team Foundation Server (TFS) up to production for faster and simpler deliveries. With pre-defined release paths, InRelease automatically deploys your application as a whole to multiple environments. Based on a business-approval workflow, InRelease improves coordination and communication between development, operations and quality assurance to make release cycles repeatable, visible, and more efficient. InRelease leverages the TFS integration platform to support multiple release scenarios from TFS and provide a complete release solution. In this session, we will show you how InRelease can help by automating deployments from TFS up to production to make release cycles faster, repeatable and more efficient. We will first review common development release scenarios, introduce related topics and terminology and will then go into more details on the Release Management tool itself by doing a walkthrough.\u003c/p\u003e",

But by doing so, we unintentionally mask the availability concern. Yes, calling a service with three lines of code is indeed simple looking and easy. But, it hides a lot of What-ifs. What if the service is not up? What if the client called the method and the service operation is executing and the operation timed out on the client side, but the operation completed on the server side? What if this was a web service in a land far far away? Should we need to retry the failed operation? Can we safely retry the operation?
